When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share the project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want to control changes to the code by pushing the master to GitHub.  Automatic pulling from Github could corrupt the local Git repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks (copying a repository) happens only on the GitHub server.  Cloning a repository happens on the local PC or from a remote server to the local PC.  Branches only occur on the local PC.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
